    "You should submit **this Jupyter notebook only**. **This must be a `.ipynb` file, not a pdf file or any other file type**. **You may use `numpy` in your code for this assignment but no other library. There are no additional marks based on overall quality and clarity of the submission.**\n",

    "The last thing you should do before submitting the notebook is to Restart Kernel and Run All Cells. You should then save the notebook and submit the .ipynb file. **You will lose one mark if you submit a notebook that has not been run.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The usual submission rules and those rules stated at the end of this document apply. In particular, the noon deadline is strict. You should not wait until the very last moment to submit your work and you should make sure that you submit the correct work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that, in line with university policy, you must declare the use of a generative Artificial Intelligence such as ChatGPT in your submission, including your reason for using it. If you do this please include any such declaration in markdown cells. You risk losing marks for using a generative Artificial Intelligence, depending on your reasons for doing so, and this will be judged on a case by case basis.**\n",
